# Prediction on the Churn through Classification

In this project, we approach a model, based on a dataset from a telecommunications company,
to create a chance of retaining old clients.

## Major Challenges
Missing Dataset: 10 users' data are missing.

Imbalanced Data: More than half as many non-churned customers data as churned customers data

## Models
Normal Logistic Regression


## Optimization Method
L2 Penalizaton

Undersampling


Oversampling


Decreasing Threshold
